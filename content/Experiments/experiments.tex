\section{Data selection}
The data selection was dictated by our problem. Indeed evaluating 3D scenes 
reconstructions is not an easy task due to the lack of 3D ground-truths. These
are usually very expensive due to costly hardware scanners but sometimes are 
also not really available, as in our scenario, where we would like a static-dynamic
segmentation. In our case in fact obtaining the static part would mean to 
actually clean the scene from all the possible moving objects which adds 
an extra cost in terms of time, but in other scenarios 'cleaning' the environment
could not be allowed.

\paragraph{EPIC-Diff.}For this fact we evaluated our scene reconstructions on a subsample\footnote{\textcolor{red}{Come giustifichiamo l'aver preso non tutte le scene? Per motivi di tempo Ã¨ accettabile?}}
of the EPIC-KITCHENS extension proposed in NeuralDiff~\cite{neuraldiff},known as EPIC-Diff. In this extension
the authors of NeuralDiff added manually pixelwise segmented masks for ten scenes of which we just considered the 
P01-01,P03-04,P04-01,P09-02,P16-01,P21-01 splits.

\paragraph{VISOR.}We looked also for 
the more recent VISOR~\cite{visor} dataset in which pixel annotations of hands 
and active objects are given but unfortunately their definition of \textit{active}
was not suitable for our work. They labeled as active any object that is 
included in the current action, so it is common to see as active the sink or 
the gas stove, but in our case they should be considered as static(see Figure~\ref{fig:vis_exp}).

\section{COLMAP Reconstruction}
Once we have fixed the data we were working on, we proceeded to do some experiments
on COLMAP reconstructions. In particular we took the scene P01-01 and tried varying 
both the number of frames and their resolution for the reconstruction. In fact most
of the scene have too many frames to handle, which could results in out of memory issues
or at the least worst in a long computational time. Our aim was to find a good compromise
between \textit{quality of reconstruction} and \textit{computational time}.

\paragraph{Quantity vs Quality }The first thing we did was to subsample the frames using the same technique 
as reported in Epic FIELDS~\cite{epic_fields} and explained in Section~\ref{sec:sampl}.
We report the results of the COLMAP reeconstructions both quantitatively and qualitatively
in Tables~\ref{tab:col_P01_01_frames},~\ref{tab:col_P01_01_res} and Figures~\ref{fig:colmap_P01_frames},~\ref{fig:colmap_P01_res}. It is worth noting
few things watching these references. The first one is that the 
resolution plays an important role in the successfulness of the reconstruction as 
we can see from Table~\ref{tab:col_P01_01_res}. The same split
of frames is reported and the right one at a resolution of 114x64 failed. This 
is due to the feature extractor, that in a high resolution image can retrieve 
informations that instead are lost in low resolution frames. A lack of significant features 
means no matching between images so the reconstruction has very few frames matched.
The second thing is that the higher the frames the better. In fact chances of matching
increases and also we will have more areas of the environment covered, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:colmap_P01_frames}.
We can see that augmenting the number of frames more parts of the kitchen are revealed,
\textit{e.g.} the round table at the center of the room, the sideboard in front of the sink.
But also some important objects that are visible from the video,like dishes on top 
of the table. This is a keypoint to the development of our pipeline, because we need to 
be sure that the scene actually contains points deriving from the motion of objects.

By considering these results and always keeping in mind the time of computation at our disposal
we opted to feed the next pipeline with around five thousands frames at a resolution 
of 228x128. The pipeline of NeuralDiff in fact is really heavy and working at full resolution
was prohibitive in the number of experiments we could try.

\end{figure}
\section{Monocular Pipeline}
Here I report the qualitative result obtained from the Monocular Pipeline. As expected the results are really poor.
The main reason of the failure of this technique is due to the inaccuracy of the depth estimator. In Figure~\ref{fig:Monoc} we can see
that in some scene it seems to capture the main elements, like the hands in scene  P01-01 or the pot in scene P16-01. However others like P09-02 seem
to completely get it wrong.

Once the frames are 
projected in the environment space we also have to find a threshold for the distance at which a reconstruction point is labeled as 
dynamic or static. This make the pipeline highly scene-specific requiring each time a lot of fine tuning for a mediocre result.

Also using a distance principle for segmentation, we can see how the scene is deteriorated in this form of globular groups of points(see Figure~\ref{fig:glob}).
While in Figure~\ref{fig:glob2} we can see how the segmentation of what is dynamic and what is static change changing the distance threshold. In particular the 
scene take was P03-04 and the values reported are 0.5, 5 and 20.

\begin{figure}[H]

    left side we can find the static part while in the right side we have the dynamic points. Here we can notice 
    how this method is pretty inaccurate.}\label{fig:glob2}
\end{figure}

\section{Sampling Frames}
In order to work with the NeuralDiff pipeline that follows this section, we have to further downsample the frames reconstructed by COLMAP
to have some reasonable computational times. We found that at a resolution of 114x64 $\sim1000$ a scene took  $\sim4h$ while at 228x128 $\sim700$ 
a scene took  $\sim11h$. In Table~\ref{tab:samplingInt700} and Table~\ref{tab:samplingInt1000} we can see the number of frames kept at each sampling 
step, obtained usiing Homography filter and the proposed Intelligent Sampling(see Section~\ref{sec:sampl}).
\input{content/Experiments/Tabs/samplingSteps1000.tex}

\section{NeuralDiff Pipeline}
\paragraph{Different number of samples for the same scene.}
To evaluate our final pipeline we started by creating the splits upon which we would have trained the neural render.
In particular we focused on one scene, P01-01, to see how the number of frames selected and the method which 
selects them affect the pipeline performances.
In Figure~\ref{fig:samplFreq} it is given a visualization of the three different subsampling obtained using the methods presented
in Section~\ref{sec:sampl} for a total of 217 frames.

We then proceeded in testing the various split for P01-01 obtaining the results reported in Table~\ref{tab:EpicInt114}.
As we can see the Intelligent sampling is actually working. The PSNR is always higher with respect to the other methods.
It can be seen that actually all methods suffer the scarcity of frames and as a matter of fact in the last split, 217, 
uniform sampling beats the intelligent one. For the static PSNR instead the Intelligent method is always better
than the uniform one, even at low frames. For the mean Average Precision instead we can see some oscillations,
but we have to be careful since our mask is actually combining the actor and the foreground layer, meaning that 
the average precision is not actually assessing the ability of the model to distinguish these two parts. 
For example in Figure~\ref{fig:comp} we can see that in the 400 frames splits is exactly present this deficit, where the 
uniform sampling is totally unable to detect the actor even though its mAP is higher than the Intelligent 
one($mAP_{Uniform}61.6\% > mAP_{Intelligent}56.63\%$).

Also for our aim to segment dynamic objects, we are interested in the static PSNR (as we obtain dynamic objects as 
what is NOT static) and Figure~\ref{fig:comp} shows us that the static part is almost identical for each scene.




\paragraph{Qualitative Results}On the other hand,going towards qualitative results, here we present the 3D static reconstruction for P01-01.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:statP01_01},the first row is the COLMAP pointcloud extracted from the sampled videosequence. Below are placed
instead the static reconstructions for the three different sampling strategies. The first thing that comes to our eyes is 
the overall colour which in the Intelligent sampling seem more faithful to the reality. The second thing is the segmentation of 
the plate on the table top, which can be seen in the COLMAP row. The plate is successfully removed in the Int. sampling while
it is still visible in the other splits, although the best model was the Unif. one according to the metrics. Another example 
is given by the pan highlighted with the green circle which is removed in the Intelligent sampling while not in the others.
We can also look at scene P03-04 in Figure~\ref{fig:col_p03} where Intelligent method manage to remove the can highlighted
in red while the Uniform methods can not.

        The left box is a proposal we gave to visualize how the frames actually spread along the temporal axis, where a line is drawn in correspondence
        of each sample. The right boxes represent instead histograms with the frequencies of the samples on the entire duration of the video.}\label{fig:samplFreq}

Other comparison for the same scene P01-01 with different frames splits are provided in Figure~\ref{fig:statP01_02}. In Figure~\ref{fig:reco} we can 
find some other static reconstructions from othere scenes.

\end{figure}


\paragraph{NeuralDiff Pipeline on all Scenes.}
To further validate our results, we repeated the experiments using different scenes using a split of $\sim$1000 frames and one of $\sim700$.
 The results are reported in Table~\ref{tab:Epic_res_114} for resolution 114x64 and Table~\ref{tab:Epic_res_228} at 
 a resolution of 228x128. The results assess that our method is working.

\paragraph{Sampling and Action Distributions. } Other than the idea behind the Intelligent sampling which was expressed in Section~\ref{sec:sampl}, we found a
link between the positions of the sampled frames and the frequencies of the objects/actions that were annotated during the videos.
In Figure~\ref{fig:samplFreq} the three sampling methods are reported. 
In Figure~\ref{fig:objectP01_01} and Figure~\ref{fig:objectsScenes} are reported respectively
the comparison of Intelligent and Uniform sampling with the objects count for scene P01-01 changing number of samples,
as can be read on each sub-figure; and the comparison of Intelligent and Uniform sampling with the objects count for each scene
with fixed sampling at $\sim1000$ frames.
 
As we can see from the plots,at exception from few scenes, the profile of the Intelligent sampling looks closer
to the one of the object counts. This is giving a further explanation of the functioning of our proposed method.
In fact it means that our sampling is focusing on those areas where a lot of actions are performed. In this way
long redundant actions are filtered and only relevant frames, where multiple actions happens, are kept.

    \caption{Comparison of frequencies for the Intelligent and Uniform sampling with the Object Count for each scene at a fixed split \~1000 frames.}\label{fig:objectsScenes}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Metrics for Profile similarity. }We also tried to give a quantitative measure of similarity and dissimilarity by comparing some 
different metrics: Cosine Similarity, Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD),
Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD).
More in details:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cosine Similarity.} It is the cosine of the angle between two vectors. It is derived from the dot product:  
    \begin{equation}
        \mathbf{v_{1}} \cdot \mathbf{v_{2}} =\left\lVert\mathbf{v_{1}} \right\rVert \left\lVert\mathbf{v_{2}} \right\rVert \cos(\theta) 
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        CosineSimilarity=\cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{v_{1}} \cdot \mathbf{v_{2}} }{\left\lVert\mathbf{v_{1}} \right\rVert \left\lVert\mathbf{v_{2}} \right\rVert }
    \end{equation}
    In our case we took as vectors the bins of the frames histograms as vector one and the bins of the actions/objects as the second one.
    \item \textbf{Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD).} It is a non symmetric measure of the difference between two probability distributions
    P and Q. It represent the measure of the lost information when Q is used to approximate P.
    \begin{equation}
        D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P \| Q)=\sum_i P(i) \log _2\left(\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}\right)
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD).} It is based on the KullbackâLeibler divergence, but 
    it is modifief to be symmetric and always having a finite value.
    \begin{equation}
        \operatorname{JSD}(P \| Q)=\frac{1}{2} D(P \| M)+\frac{1}{2} D(Q \| M)
    \end{equation}
    where $M = \frac{1}{2}(P+Q)$ is a mixture distribution of P and Q.
\end{itemize}
Clearly we do not have distributions, so we obtained them by normalizing such that their elements summed to 1. The results we have obtained
are reported in Table~\ref{tab:samplMetrics}.

\section{NeuralCleaner}
As a last step, after assessing that our method was functioning, we tried to speed up the overall pipeline.
We tried to eliminate the actor layer of the NeuralDiff pipeline since we are not interested in it, as we 
only want to know what is moving. The foreground and actor layer are thus merged together and we tried to see
how much we could improve by eliminating this distinction. In Table~\ref{tab:NClean} we can see the results in comparison with
the NeuralDiff pipeline. On average we obtained a descreasing factor of $\sim30\%$.
