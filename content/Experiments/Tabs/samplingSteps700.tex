    \caption{\textbf{Split$\sim700$. }Number of frames resulting from the different sampling steps. In particular from Original the frames are 
    reduced with the Homography filter to remove redundancy and keep overlap. The reconstructed frames are the ones
    which were successfully reconstructed by COLMAP. The obtained ones are the reconstructed frames filtered again
    with the homography filter. Int/Unif Samples are the reconstructed frames without the Obtaineds. The thresholds
    reported are referred to the last Homography filter step.
